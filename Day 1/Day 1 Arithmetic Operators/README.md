## Problem Statement
Complete the following functions to calculate rectangle properties using arithmetic operators:

1. `getArea(length, width)`: Calculate and return the area of a rectangle
2. `getPerimeter(length, width)`: Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ length, width ≤ 1000
- Values have at most 3 decimal places

## Sample Input
```
3
4.5
```

## Sample Output
```
13.5
```

### Explanation
- Area = length × width (3 × 4.5 = 13.5)
- Perimeter = 2 × (length + width) = 2 × (3 + 4.5) = 15
