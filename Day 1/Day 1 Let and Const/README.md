# [Day 1: Let and Const](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-let-and-const/problem?isFullScreen=false)

## 📝 Problem Statement

In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the `let` and `const` keywords.

### Task:

1. Declare a constant variable `PI`, and assign it the value `Math.PI`.  
   ✅ **Note:** You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named `PI` (uppercase).
2. Read a number `r`, denoting the radius of a circle from `stdin`.
3. Use `PI` and `r` to calculate the **area** and **perimeter** of a circle having radius `r`.
4. Print `area` as the first line of output and `perimeter` as the second line.

### Input Format

A single floating-point number `r`, denoting the radius of a circle.

### Constraints

- \( 0 < r \leq 100 \)
- `r` is a floating-point number scaled to at most 3 decimal places.
