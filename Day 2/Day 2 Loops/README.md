## Problem Description

Complete the `vowelsAndConsonants` function that processes a string `s` by:
1. Printing each vowel in `s` on a new line in order of appearance.
2. Then printing each consonant (non-vowel) in `s` on a new line in order of appearance.

### Vowels
The English vowels are: `a, e, i, o, u` (case-sensitive, lowercase only).

### Constraints
- The input string `s` contains only lowercase English alphabetic letters.
